Simplification is the process of reducing the number of points of a polygon or polyhedron while keeping some desirable attributes (such as ensuring the object still 'looks good'). In addition, I sought to develop topologically consistent methods that avoided round-off errors due to floating point arithmetic. This was done by favoring rational arithmetic over floating point numbers, which turns out to be a much more expensive approach to arithmetic, reinforcing the need for computationally efficient methods make them feasible.","tags":["Computational Geometry","Rational Arithmetic","Parallel Computing"],"order":1,"img":{"url":"/research/images/mesh_simp.png"},"links":[{"name":"Code","url":"https://github.com/mgruppi/parallelmeshsimplification"},{"name":"Paper","url":"https://seer.ufu.br/index.php/revistabrasileiracartografia/article/download/44497/23569"}],"_id":"content:research:past:geometric_simplification.yaml","_type":"yaml","_source":"content","_file":"research/past/geometric_simplification.yaml","_extension":"yaml"}]
