In particular, I am interested in identitying behavioral and linguistic trends that specific groups of news producrs exhibit, and how to leverage such trends to better understand the landscape and predict sources of misinformation.","tags":["Misinformation","NLP","Machine Learning","Network Science"],"order":1,"img":{"url":"/research/images/nela.png"},"links":[{"name":"NELA dataset","url":"https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/nela"},{"name":"Paper (report)","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05659"}],"_id":"content:research:projects:news_landscape.yaml","_type":"yaml","_source":"content","_file":"research/projects/news_landscape.yaml","_extension":"yaml"},{"_path":"/research/projects/semantic_change","_dir":"projects","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Lexical Semantic Change","title_icon":"fas fa-language","description":"The goal of this project is to understand the process of semantic change in languages across time and space.
