  <h1> About me</h1>

  <p>
    I am a PhD student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (since 2017).
    My research interests include machine learning and natural language processing methods and applications,
    particularly to misinformation, and language change and bias.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, my research focus on automatic methods for discovery and explanation of language change/bias.
    My goal is to find ways to understand and explain the divergence in language usage in different domains,
    and how those can be used by humans and machines.
