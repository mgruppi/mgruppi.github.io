            I am a PhD Candidate at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (since 2017).
            My research interests include machine learning and natural language processing methods and applications,
            particularly to misinformation, and semantic change and bias.

            <p class="">
            Currently, my research focus on methods for semantic change detection and language representation.
            My goal is to find ways to understand and explain the divergence in language usage in different domains,
            and how those can be used by humans and machines.
