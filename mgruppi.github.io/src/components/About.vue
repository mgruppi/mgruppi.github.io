                I am a PhD Candidate at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (joined in 2017) under the advisorship of professor <a href="https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~sibel/www/index.html">Sibel Adalı</a>.
                My research interests include machine learning and natural language processing methods and applications,
                particularly to misinformation, and semantic change and bias.

                My research focus on methods and applications of semantic change detection and language representation.
                My goal is to find ways to understand and explain the divergence in language usage in different domains,
                and how those can be used by humans and machines. And also to explore how language shift can be used to uncover latent
                differences across time and domain.
